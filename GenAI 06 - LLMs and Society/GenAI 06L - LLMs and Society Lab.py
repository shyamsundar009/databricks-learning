# MAGIC # LLMs and Society Lab
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## Learning Objectives
# MAGIC By the end of this lab, you should be able to:
# MAGIC 1. Evaluate polarity towards certain demographic groups using `regard`
# MAGIC 2. Test your language model by changing text using `sparknlp` 

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Requirements
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Please review the following requirements before starting the lesson:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * To run this notebook, you need to use one of the following Databricks runtime(s): **13.3.x-cpu-ml-scala2.12, 13.3.x-gpu-ml-scala2.12**

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Classroom Setup
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Before starting the demo, run the provided classroom setup script. This script will define configuration variables necessary for the demo. Execute the following cells to setup the classroom environment:

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %pip install nlptest==1.4.0

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %run ../Includes/Classroom-Setup

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Evaluate Regard 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We will use the [BOLD dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/AlexaAI/bold), created by Alexa AI, that allows us to evaluate model fairness in English text generation. Specifically, we will use categories within this dataset to prompt the language model for text completion. Some example categories include:
# MAGIC - gender 
# MAGIC - professions
# MAGIC - religions
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Continuing from the demo, we will use the same `evaluate` library from Hugging Face, but leverage a separate module called `regard`. We evaluate model fairness from the angle of polarity or perception to see if one group is assigned a higher regard score than the other.  
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **ðŸ“Œ Note:** If you get an error due to dataset's *splits sizes verification*, you can turn off the **`verification_mode`** by uncommenting the `verification_mode` line.

# COMMAND ----------

from datasets import load_dataset

# Note: We specify cache_dir to use pre-cached data.
bold = load_dataset(
    "AlexaAI/bold", 
    split="train", 
    cache_dir=DA.paths.datasets,
    # verification_mode="no_checks"

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC In this exercise, we will examine whether people in the `dance_occupations` are regarded any differently than those in `scientific_occupations`.

# MAGIC ## Bonus: NLP Test
# MAGIC
# MAGIC To switch gears a bit, we will now turn to looking at how we can test our NLP models and see how safe and effective they are using `nlptest`. The [library](https://nlptest.org/) is developed by SparkNLP and aims to provide user-friendly APIs to help evaluate models. This library was just released in April 2023. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The test categories include:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Accuracy
# MAGIC - Bias
# MAGIC - Fairness
# MAGIC - Representation
# MAGIC - Robustness
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Currently, the library supports either `text-classification` or `ner` task.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC To start, we will use the `Harness` class to define what types of tests we would like to conduct on any given NLP model. You can read more about [Harness here](https://nlptest.org/docs/pages/docs/harness). The cell below provides a quick one-liner to show how you can evaluate the model, `dslim/bert-base-NER` from HuggingFace on a Named Entity Recognition (NER) task.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC You can choose to provide your own saved model or load existing models from `spacy` or `John Snow Labs` as well. 

# COMMAND ----------

from nlptest import Harness

# Create a Harness object
h = Harness(task="ner", model="dslim/bert-base-NER", hub="huggingface")

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC We won't run the following cell since it could take up to 7 mins. This is a one-liner that runs all tests against the language model you supply. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Notice that it consists of three steps: 
# MAGIC 1. Generate test cases
# MAGIC 2. Run the test cases
# MAGIC 3. Generate a report of your test cases

# COMMAND ----------

# h.generate().run().report()

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC If you do run `h.generate().run.report()` above, you can see that the report generates different test cases from different `test_type` and `category`. Specifically, it's unsurprising to see that the model fails the `lowercase` test for a NER use case. After all, if we lowercase all names, it would be hard to tell if the names are indeed referring to proper nouns, e.g. "the los angeles time" vs. "the Los Angeles Times".
# MAGIC
# MAGIC You can get a complete list of tests in their [documentation](https://nlptest.org/docs/pages/tests/test). For example, for `add_typo`, it checks whether the NLP model we use can handle input text with typos.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## Summary
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this lab, we learned how to assess the demographic bias in language models and evaluate language fairness. In the final section, we conducted an additional NLP evaluation, specifically testing NLP models to gauge their safety and effectiveness.
